# CHEAP-PHP

Cheap is another unnecessary php framework. it's not here to compete with anything out there. It's simply me attempting to build my own simple MVC Framework as it was required for a test.

Cheap Provides a Router with Parameter Detection functionality.

Simply create a controller and a method and point your routes to get started. 

Cheap has support for **twig** templating engine.
